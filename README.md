# Lootiful

**Pixely Roguelike Loot Crawler** for [ReactJam 2024](https://reactjam.com).

The game was created in a span of 7 Days (monday to monday) in May of 2024.

## How To Play

Use the MOUSE to click around. You can move one space at a time. ENEMIES will only MOVE if
you MOVE, and only ATTACK when you ATTACK.

Each dungeon dive lasts while you have STAMINA and HEALTH, each action drains your STAMINA.
When you run out of STAMINA, the dungeon dive ends, and a new one can be started.

To win the GAME, pickup all 14 ARTIFACTS hidden in the dungeon without DYING.

Killed ENEMIES will drop LOOT you can sell, which gives you COINS. COINS can be used to
enhance your ATTRIBUTES. This will increase your HEALTH and STAMINA, which will give you
more chances to find LOOT and lets you stay longer in the dungeon.

## Technology

React Three Fiber was used for graphics, pure React for everything else. No game-engine or state-management library was used. (Which was okay, but i was reaching limitations at the end.)
